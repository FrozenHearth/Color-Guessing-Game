# Color Guessing Game

A color guessing game that runs on the web which was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript done in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy and re-written in ES6 and modern CSS. Players can toggle between Easy and Hard modes and have to pick the correct square based on the RGB color given in the header.
